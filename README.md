#Magic the Gathering Database

- This is our Magic the Gathering database prototype. The user can read and write to our SQL database
  using our web app to view each entry.
- Our goal for this project was to recreate a powerful Magic the Gathering card view and search engine.
- We set out with a vision that was inspired by the popular MTG database, Scryfall.



#The User Can:

- Search through our data using the dynamic search bar on the landing page.
- View the contents of the database with clickable card images to view in a focused view.
- View the entire contents of the database as an organized list that contains all data fields.
- Create a custom card and insert it into the database for the duration of the session.
- Can view the custom created card in the image list and the organized table.
- View the raw json data through the settings icon on the lower left of the landing page.
- Return to the landing page at any time by clicking on the MTG logo at the top of the window.
- Visit the creators GitHub accounts via the button links at the bottom of any window.
